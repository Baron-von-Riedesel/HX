
 1. About

  JHDPMI is a JLM that allows to hook into the v86-mode interrupt chain,
 without modifying the IVT. This ensures the client will be the very first
 to be called when an IRQ is triggered, no matter what the corresponding
 vector in the IVT is telling.
  There are 2 variants of the hook API: the first and simplest method
 expects a v86-mode vector that will be called if the interrupt occurs.
 The second method is for VCPI clients only; they may be notified directly
 by the VCPI host, without making a detour through v86-mode.


 2. Install/Uninstall JHDPMI

 JHDPMI can be installed either as a device driver in CONFIG.SYS:

   DEVICE=JLOAD.EXE JHDPMI.DLL

 or as a TSR from the command line:

   JLOAD JHDPMI.DLL

 To uninstall, use JLOAD's -u option:

   JLOAD -u JHDPMI.DLL


 3. Using JHDPMI

 The intended usage is for HDPMI to ensure it's the first to get interrupts
 that occur in v86-mode, without the ugly ( and not really well functioning )
 need to hook into the IVT for all IRQs. But JHDPMI may be useful for other
 purposes as well.


 4. Technical Details

 JHDPMI supplies a real-mode interface. The Carry flag indicates an error.
 Device ID is 4858h, functions are:

 AX=0000h: Get Version
      out: AX=version (0x100 currently)
 AX=0001h: connect
       in: -
      out: -
 AX=0002h: disconnect
       in: -
      out: -
 AX=0003h: Hook Interrupt for v86 program
       in: BL=interrupt# to hook
           CX:DX=real-mode CS:IP to call
       C if interrupt is already hooked.    
 AX=0004h: Unhook Interrupt
       in: BL=interrupt# to unhook
       C if interrupt is not hooked.    
 AX=0005h: exchange current hook vector
       in: BL=interrupt#
           CX:DX=real-mode CS:IP to call
      out: CX:DX=previous real-mode CS:IP
       C if interrupt is not hooked or hooked in VCPI mode.
 AX=0011h: Hook Interrupt in VCPI mode.
       in: BL=interrupt# to hook
           CX:DX=linear address of a VCPI_V86ToPM mode switch struct;
           must be located in first MB.
       C if interrupt is already hooked.    
 AX=0012h: Display status
       in: -
      out: -

  The protected-mode hook proc that's supplied with function AX=0011 will
 be entered with EDI=linear address of a Client_Reg_Struc that contains the
 V86 register status. JHDPMI will refuse to unload if
   a) a connection is still active or
   b) an interrupt is still hooked.

 Currently BL is restricted to:
 - 08h-0Fh (IRQ0-IRQ7)
 - 1Ch
 - 70h-77h (IRQ8-IRQ15)

 An interrupt may be hooked multiple times, there's a stack implemented, that
 is, the unhook function will restore the previous value. The total number of
 hooks, however, is limited to 255.
 Jemm v5.84+ is required.
