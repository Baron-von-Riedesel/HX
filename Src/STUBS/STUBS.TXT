 The binaries which are created from the DPMISTUB.ASM/LOADPE.ASM sources
 are "stubs". Such stubs don't run as standalone binaries but are added 
 - usually by the linker - to other binaries. They will only run if the
 operating system doesn't understand the file format of the target binary.

 Makefile will create 5 stubs, DPMIST32.BIN, DPMIST16.BIN, LOADPE.BIN,
 LOADPEX.BIN and LOADPXNR.BIN.


 2. DPMIST32.BIN
 
 DPMIST32.BIN is a stub file supposed to replace the default stub of
 Win32 console mode apps. The replacement is done by:

   - for new executables use a linker option (i.e. /STUB:DPMIST32.BIN)
   - for existing apps use tool PEStub.exe

 The modified application should run as before as long as it runs in a
 Win32 environment. In true DOS, however, the stub will gain control
 and try to find and launch HX's PE file loader DPMILD32.EXE. DPMILD32
 will be searched in the current directory and then in the directories
 of the PATH environment variable. 


 3. DPMIST16.BIN

 This is a stub intended to be added to 16-bit NE binaries. Instead of
 searching DPMILD32.EXE, this stub searches DPMILD16.EXE, which is HX's
 NE file loader. It's only of interest if a 16-bit HX binary is created,
 which requires the HXDEV16 package. See documentation of this package
 for more details.


 4. LOADPE.BIN, LOADPEX.BIN and LOADPXNR.BIN

 These stubs contain a simplified PE loader by itself. So - unlike 
 DPMIST32.BIN - no external binary is needed to load the application.
 However, the application must be a DOS binary and must NOT contain 
 references to other PE modules (no imports). LOADPE.BIN will load
 HDPMI32 if no DPMI host is installed, LOADPEX.BIN contains HDPMI32
 already and will activate it if no host is active. LOADPXNR.BIN is
 like LOADPE.BIN, but lacks the ability to relocate the binary - it
 must be loaded at its preferred address. Hence this version needs a
 host that supports int 31h, ax=504h.


 5. History

 07/2022: added int 41h debug support to loadpe.
 05/2018: added another version of LOADPE: LOADPXNR.BIN.
 03/2008: "out of memory" error msg added to LOADPE.
          DPMIST32.ASM can be assembled with WASM now.
 02/2008: bugfix: DPMISTUB.ASM assumed a max. short path length of
          70, but it is 80 (64+3+12+1).
 01/2008: added LOADPE.ASM and stubs LOADPE.BIN/LOADPEX.BIN.
