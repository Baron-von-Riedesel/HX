 HXGUIHLP is a dll to support running Win32 GUI apps with HX.
 It is loaded automatically by DPMILD32 if a Win32 GUI app is to be
 launched. Its purpose is
 
  - to set the screen in graphics mode
  - optionally register a hotkey to display a menu
  - optionally load some fonts 
  - route some parameters found in hxguihlp.ini to VESA32.DLL
 
 The hotkey to display the menu is the APPS key. This may be changed
 in hxguihlp.ini.
 
 The menu which will be displayed is:
 
    ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
    ³  F3: Maximize main window         ³
    ³  F4: Send close request to window ³
    ³  F5: Save screen in BMP file      ³
    ³  F6: Save main window in BMP file ³
    ³  F9: DOS shell                    ³
    ³ F12: Terminate application        ³
    ³ ESC: Cancel                       ³
