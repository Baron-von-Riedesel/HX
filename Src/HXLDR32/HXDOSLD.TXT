
  About HXDOSLD

  HXDOSLD is used to bypass an installed HXLDR32. This is rarely needed.
  HXLDR32 will launch HX's DPMILD32 if it founds a PE binary to be run.
  Sometimes this isn't appropriate because it doesn't allow a stub in
  this binary to be executed. If this stub should run while HXLDR32 is
  installed use HXDOSLD.
  
  Usage:
  
  HXDOSLD name_of_binary [ parameters ]
  
  If no path is given with the name of the binary, it must be found in
  the current directory.
