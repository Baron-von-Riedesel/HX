
  1. About

   PatchNE is used to set some values in the header of an NE binary.
  The most important is field "operating system" at offset 36h. PatchNE
  sets it to either DPMI-16 (5) or DPMI-32 (6). The value for DPMI-16
  is the same as used by Borland's 16-bit DPMI  extender. DPMI-32 is 
  special for HX and will be unknown for NE file dumpers.
   There are additional options to make binaries created for Borland's
  Powerpack extender (RTM.EXE and DPMI16BI.OVL) compatible with HX's
  DPMILD16. 
  

  2. Usage
  
  To mark a NE application as 16-Bit client, enter
  
   patchNE appname
   
  To mark a NE application as 32-Bit client, enter 

   patchNE -32 appname
   
  This is required because the OMF linkers knowing how to create
  NE binaries most likely will not know how to set values for field
  "operating system" others than OS/2 or Windows. 
  
  Other options are:
  
  -n: dont touch application type flags. Without this option the 
      "application type" bits in the NE header are set to "fullscreen".
  -r: mark application as RTM binary. This flag will instruct DPMILD16
      to allocate alias descriptors for all code segments, which copies
      the RTM.EXE behaviour. 
  -s: this goes one step further than -r option and replaces the MZ stub
      in the NE binary with DPMIST16.BIN (which must be located in the 
      current directory).
  -v: makes patchne.exe tell what it has done.
