
 1. About
 
 WSOCK32.DLL implements HX's WinSocket emulation. Since version 1.4 this
 emulation is based on WatTCP/Watt-32, previously it contained just dummy
 entries.

 3. Hints / Known Problems
 
 þ if Winsocket "doesn't work", try to run TEST\WSTEST with a parameter
   and see if any error messages are displayed.
   
 þ if the app you were trying to run crashes and the WSOCK32.DLL is
   suspected to cause the crash, try the version in HX\Unsupp, which
   just is a dummy and see if the crash disappears with this version.
   
 þ if you get error: "all attempts to get an IP address ... failed"
   then search for file %TEMP%\W32DHCP.TMP and delete it.

 
 4. History

 2011/05/27 V1.8

 þ bugfix: ioctlsocket() with parameter FIONBIO didn't work due to
   a bug in WATT32.
 þ tcp_fsm module from WATT32 v2.2r10 is now used.

 2009/11/16 V1.7

 þ inet_addr() did return bytes in wrong order, inet_ntoa() used them
   in wrong order.
 þ field iMaxUdpDg in WSADATA is now initialized to 1472, which is the
   max size for WatTCP.
 þ getsockopt() value SO_MAX_MSG_SIZE supported (returns 1472).
 þ WSAStartup() won't clear the lpVendorInfo field in WSADATA anymore.
 þ connect() in non-blocking mode returned WSAINPROGRESS, now returns
   WSAWOULDBLOCK.
 þ bugfix: WSAStartup() couldn't be called again once WSACleanup() was
   called.
 þ WSAAsyncSelect() supported.

 2006/10/15 V1.6

 þ accept() didn't terminate, even if closesocket() for this socket
   has been called.
 
 2006/05/15 V1.5
 
 þ check for NULL as sockets in select() and set error WSAENOTSOCK.
 þ WSACancelAsyncRequest, WSAAsyncGetHostByName added (dummies)
 
 2006/02/28 V1.4
 
 þ now using WatTCP/Watt-32 to implement WinSocket emulation.
   (WATT32 v2.2r9).
 
 2006/01/06 V1.3
 
 þ getpeername, getprotobyname, getprotobynumber, getservbyname,
   getservbyport, getsockopt added (dummies)
 þ gethostbyaddr added (dummy)
 þ WSASetBlockingHook, WSAUnhookBlockingHook, WSACancelBlockingCall
   added (dummies)
   
 2005/12/07 V1.2
 
 þ allow WSAStartup to succeed
 
 2005/11/24 V1.1
 
 þ ordinal numbers of exports adjusted to match the ones of Win32.
 
 2005/10/10 V1.0
