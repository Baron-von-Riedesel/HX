
 1. About
 
 OLE32.DLL is HX's OLE32 emulation. It's very rudimentary, though, and
 most functions are just dummies. However, CoCreateInstance is implemented
 and so some very basic COM support is available in HX. Only dll servers
 (in-process-servers) may work. Creating DirectDraw, DirectInput or
 DirectSound objects with CoCreateInstance should work if file "classes"
 is setup accordingly.

 3. History

 05/27/2011: V1.10

 þ StringFromGUID2 did always return S_OK (=0).
 þ stubs CreateItemMoniker + GetRunningObjectTable added.
 þ CoGetClassObject added

 11/16/2009: V1.9
 
 þ OleFlushClipboard added (dummy).
 þ CoInitializeSecurity added (dummy).
 
 01/20/2009: V1.8
 
 þ source assembled with JWasm.
 
 01/11/2008: V1.7
 
 þ StgOpenStorage added (dummy)
 þ CreateStreamOnHGlobal added (dummy)
 
 07/15/2007: V1.6
 
 þ CoTaskMemRealloc added
 þ CoGetMalloc added
 þ CLSIDFromString, IIDFromString implemented
 
 10/15/2006: V1.5
 
 þ CoInitializeEx added to make Allegro happy
 þ OleUninitialize added

 03/11/2006: V1.4
 
 þ OleInitialize, CoTaskMemAlloc, CoTaskMemFree added
 
 01/22/2006: V1.3
 
 þ CoCreateInstance now understands to load an in-proc-server
   and create a COM object. This is mainly to support applications
   using CoCreateInstance to create an DirectDraw, DirectInput or DirectSound
   instance.
 þ StringFromGUID2 implemented.
 
 12/12/2005: V1.2
 
 þ CoCreateGuid added (dummy)
 þ CoCreateInstance added (dummy)
 
 06/06/2005: V1.1
 
 þ functions CLSIDFromProgID, ProgIDFromCLSID, CoCreateInstance (dummies)
   added.
