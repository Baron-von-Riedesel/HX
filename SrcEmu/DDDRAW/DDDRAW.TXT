
  1. About
  
  DDDRAW.DLL is part of HX's Win32 emulation. It will be loaded by
  DPMILD32 instead of the Win32 DirectDraw dll DDRAW.DLL.
  
  DDDRAW.DLL requires VESA linear frame buffer (LFB) to work. The DirectDraw
  emulation has to work without hardware acceleration, so it cannot be as
  fast as in windows. But for 2D graphics this should be no problem.
  

  2. DirectDraw Functions 

  Interfaces implemented are:
  
  - IDirectDraw
  - IDirectDraw2
  - IDirectDraw4
  - IDirectDraw7
  - IDirectDrawSurface
  - IDirectDrawSurface2
  - IDirectDrawSurface3
  - IDirectDrawSurface4
  - IDirectDrawSurface7
  - IDirectDrawPalette
  - IDirectDrawClipper

  But even if the interfaces are implemented, this doesn't mean that
  all methods are implemented as well. Especially all new methods 
  introduced with IDirectDraw4, IDirectDraw7, IDirectDrawSurface4 and
  IDirectDrawSurface7 will return error "not implemented".


  3. History
  
  2009/01/20: Version 2.8
  
  þ source assembled with JWasm.
 
  2008/01/11: Version 2.7
  
  þ Blt doesn't hide + redraw cursor if no primary surface is involved.
  
  2007/03/15: Version 2.6

  þ DirectDrawPalette will use the GDI palette functions now.
    This ensures that GDI always knows the correct state of the palette.
  þ DirectDrawGammaControl interface implemented (dummy)
    

  2006/09/14: Version 2.5

  þ DirectDrawEnumerateEx added
  
  2006/06/14: Version 2.4

  þ bugfix: IDirectDrawPalette::SetEntries may have written beyond 
    the palette table
  
  2006/04/21: Version 2.3
  
  þ IDirectDraw4 and IDirectDrawSurface4 implemented (dummy)
  þ IDirectDraw7 and IDirectDrawSurface7 implemented (dummy)
  
  2006/02/24: Version 2.2
  
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::GetDDInterface implemented.
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::Initialize now returns DDERR_ALREADYINITIALIZED.
  
  2006/02/06: Version 2.1
  
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::GetColorKey/SetColorKey now return DD_OK.
    But colorkeys still are ignored in DDDRAW.
  þ bugfix: IDirectDrawSurface::GetDC didn't work for off-video surfaces.
  þ bugfix: IDirectDrawSurface::GetDC always returned DC for current
    primary surface memory.
  þ bugfix: IDirectDrawSurface::Flip with triple buffers didn't work
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::GetFlipStatus now calls GetVesaFlipStatus.
  þ bugfix: video mode wasn't restored for IDirectDraw2 objects
    if SetCooperativeLevel was set back to normal.
  þ video mode automatically restored if directdraw object is released.
              
  2006/01/22: Version 2.0
  
  þ call DisableThreadLibraryCalls in DllMain
  þ bugfix: IDirectDrawSurface::Flip didn't work with more than
    one backbuffer. 
  þ bugfix: IDirectDrawPalette::GetCaps returned wrong value
  þ bugfix: IDirectDrawSurface::GetPixelFormat didn't set  
    correct flags for 8-bit palette modes.
  þ DllGetClassObject added to make DDDRAW.DLL COM compatible.
  þ DirectDrawEnumerateA added
  
  2006/01/02: Version 1.9
  
  þ bugfix: Restoring video state didn't always work.
  
  2005/12/20: Version 1.8
  
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::Blt speed optimisation for P4 CPUs.
  þ bugfix: creating a surface with flag DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN 
    set allocated the surface memory in video memory. Now this
    is only done for DDSCAPS_VIDEOMEMORY. 
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::Blt speed optimisation for CPUs < P4.
  þ bugfix: IDirectDrawSurface::Blt colorfill didn't work for 24 bpp
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::IsLost implemented
  
  2005/12/07: Version 1.7
  
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::BltFast implemented
  þ bugfix: USER32 function address "SendMessage" was not found
    (correct name is "SendMessageA")
  þ IDirectDrawSurface:GetSurfaceDesc returns lpSurface.
  
  2005/11/24: Version 1.6
  
  þ bugfix: IDirectDrawSurface::Flip didn't work as expected
  þ bugfix: the mouse cursor wasn't shown on flipping surfaces.
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::GetFlipStatus implemented
  þ bugfix: hiding mouse cursor didn't work for GUI apps
  þ bugfix: IDirectDraw2::GetAvailableVidMem returned wrong
    values.
    
  2005/11/18: Version 1.5
  
  þ IDirectDraw::GetGDISurface implemented
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::GetPixelFormat implemented
  þ IDirectDrawSurface::Blt now works with DDBLT_COLORFILL
  þ bugfix: destroying a DirectDraw object may have deactivated the mouse.
    
  2005/11/01: Version 1.4
  
  þ IDirectDraw::EnumDisplayModes: only enum gfx modes with LFB
    support
  þ bugfix: use ChangeDisplaySettingsA to change video mode if
    a GUI app is running.
  þ bugfix: IDirectSurface:GetCaps wrote to a wrong address
  
  2005/10/24: Version 1.3
  
  þ IDirectDrawSurface2, IDirectDrawSurface3, IDirectDrawClipper
    implemented.
  þ DDDRAW.DLL linked dynamically with VESA32.
  
  2005/09/25: Version 1.2
  
  þ DDDRAW.DLL now linked statically with VESA32.
  þ IDirectDrawSurface: methods Blt, Flip, GetAttachedSurface,
    EnumAttachedSurfaces, DeleteAttachedSurface, GetSurfaceDesc,
    GetDC, ReleaseDC implemented.
    IDirectDraw2: methods GetAvailableVideoMemory implemented.
    
  2005/06/14: Version 1.1
  
  þ IDirectDraw::RestoreDisplayMode now uses VESA save/restore
    state functions. 
  þ IDirectDraw::GetCaps implemented
  þ IDirectDraw::GetCurrentMode implemented
  þ IDirectDraw::EnumDisplayModes implemented
  
  2005/06/07: Version 1.0
