
  1. About
  
  DINPUT.DLL is part of HX's GUI extension. SDL will preferably use
  DINPUT.DLL and DDRAW.DLL if they are compatible. Else GDI32 (DIB)
  and USER32 keyboard/mouse messages will be used.
  

  2. DirectInput Functions 

  Interfaces implemented are:
  
  - IDirectInputA
  - IDirectInput2A
  - IDirectInput7A
  - IDirectInputDeviceA
  - IDirectInputDevice2A
  - IDirectInputDevice7A

  Currently only the keyboard and mouse devices work.
  Some methods are not implemented yet, though.
  
  Properties which are implemented are BUFFERSIZE and AXISMODE.
