Updates to the HX DOS Extender

Since the site www.japheth.de is no longer functional, I'm going to submit updates to the HX DOS Extender here.

The binaries are usually supposed to be build with JWasm (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jwasm/files/?source=navbar) and JWlink (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jwlink/files/?source=navbar). The makefiles are in MS NMake format.

Pregenerated binaries may be found in the bin subdirectory.
