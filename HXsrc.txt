
  1. About

  This package contains the source code of HX DOS extender.
  It may be unzipped in HX's runtime or its own directory.


  2. How to create the Binaries

  Ensure that all components needed for the make process are installed.
  These are:
    - the HXDEV package
    - JWasm
    - JWlink ( must be at least v19beta15 )
    - JWlib ( contained in the JWlink package )
    - NMake ( or compatible make utility, recommended: Open Watcom WMake )
    - WRC ( resource compiler of Open Watcom, needed for DUSER32.DLL)

  If the make process is to run in DOS, a Win32 environment has to be set
  up. This means, one has to
    - install the HXRT package
    - set environment variable DPMILDR=8
    - run HXLdr32
    - either set environment variable HDPMI=32 or run "HDPMI32 -r -a".

  The files SRC/dirs and SRCEMU/dirs most likely must be modified before
  starting the make process. In these files the directory where HXDEV/HXRT has
  been installed is defined. All the binaries listed above must be accessible 
  through the PATH environment variable, so you may have to adjust this
  variable.

  After the modifications have been done, switch to the SRC directory and
  enter "NMAKE" ( or, if you have choosen wmake, enter "WMAKE -ms" instead ).
  After this process has run (hopefully) successfully, change to directory
  SRCEMU and repeat this step. At last, install the generated files by
  running "NMAKE install", again in both directories.

  Note that the WSOCK32 binary is currently excluded from the build because
  some modules are missing due to copyright issues.
