
  1. About

  The HX DOS extender runtime allows to run HX DOS extended or Win32
  console applications in DOS. Furthermore there is limited support
  for running Win32 graphics applications (DirectDraw, GDI, OpenGL).

  HX has been tested to run with MS-DOS v5/6/7 and FreeDOS v1.0.
  It might work with other DOS versions, but this is untested and not 
  recommended.


  2. Installation

  To install the HX DOS extender runtime do:

  þ unzip HXRT in a directory of your choice, for example C:\HX.

  þ include the BIN subdirectory (C:\HX\BIN) into the PATH environment
    variable, which usually is set in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT.
    Or copy the files from C:\HX\BIN to a directory included in PATH.


  3. Requirements

  - CPU: the DPMI hosts HDPMI16 and HDPMI32, the PE loader DPMILD32 and
    the Win32 emulation all need at least a 80386 cpu. Using some
    optional features might require a 80486. DPMILD16 runs on a 80286.

  - RAM: The memory footprint of the HX modules is small. A 4 MB machine
    should be able to run simple Win32 console applications. By setting
    some switches for HDPMI/DPMILD32 (see HDPMI.TXT/DPMILD32.TXT for
    details), even a 2 MB machine might suffice.

  - DOS: HDPMI and DPMILD32 work with MS-DOS 3.3 or better, the Win32
    emulation needs at least MS-DOS 5. FreeDOS 1.0 works for both as well.


  4. Running Win32 Applications

  There are 3 possible ways to run Win32 applications after HX has been
  installed:

  þ HXLdr32: This is a DOS-TSR and it doesn't require any parameters.
    Just type HXLdr32 and then try to start the Win32 apps you want to
    run. This usually is the simplest and best option to do. View 
    Doc\HXLdr32.txt for more details. 

  þ PEStub: this tool will exchange the DOS-MZ header (stub) of the PE
    binary. This should do no harm to the file, it still remains
    a valid Win32 application. In DOS the new stub will load DPMILD32
    which then will load and run the Win32 binary.

  þ DPMILD32: HX's PE loader can be used to manually start a Win32
    application. Just enter 'DPMILD32 filename'.


  5. Hints / Known Problems

  þ if HX doesn't run at all, please read TEST\README1.TXT. It describes
    a strategy how to - hopefully - find the reason for the failure.

  þ some programs may require that environment variable TZ has been set.
    This is especially true for packer/unpacker apps, which store the
    file's creation or last update time in UTC format. As an example: 
    To set TZ to time zone GMT - 2 hours enter 'set TZ=CET-2'

  þ to allow nested execution of Win32 applications it may be necessary
    to set environment variables HDPMI=32 *and* DPMILDR=8. Fore more details
    about this issue please read Doc\Compat.txt.

  þ if a program imports a dll located in the windows system directory
    avoid to include this directoy to the PATH environment variable.
    That is because some HX win32 emulation dlls have the same
    name as their windows counterparts. It is better to copy those dlls
    to a directory included in PATH. Or, if the windows system directory must
    be included in PATH, include it *after* the HX\Bin directory.

  þ the graphics routines for GDI and DirectDraw emulation require a
    VESA 2.0 Bios, since they only work with linear frame buffer (LFB)
    enabled. They most likely don't work in a WinXP DOS box.

  þ if HX is running on FreeDOS and a program crashes, run TEST\DOSTEST.EXE.
    This may show if the current configuration is compatible with HX.
    If any function fails try to disable FreeDOS' EMM386.EXE, where some
    older versions are known to cause troubles. Also ensure that the FreeDOS
    kernel you're using is not too old, the one contained in FreeDOS v1.0
    has been verified to run with HX.

  þ Sometimes DPMILD32 is unable to load a program because the currently
    loaded DPMI host doesn't provide the functions needed. HX has a modular
    design and can run on various DPMI hosts, but often HDPMI will be
    required. That's due to restrictions in other hosts, not because HDPMI
    supplies any hidden functionality. A comparison gives these results:

              DOS API        alloc linear
    host     translation   memory at 0x400000   comment
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    CWSDPMI    No             No                v5
    DPMIONE    Yes            No                also 386MAX host
    32RTM      Yes            No                Borland's PowerPack
    Win9x      Yes            No 
    WinXP      Yes            No 
    QDPMI      Yes            No
    OS2        Yes            Yes(?)
    DosEmu     Yes            Yes               v1.4.0
    HDPMI      Yes            Yes

    DPMILD32 will only load HDPMI if no DPMI host has been found. So
    other hosts should be disabled or uninstalled if DPMILD32 cannot
    load a program. Use TEST\DPMI.EXE to find out if a host offers
    the functions required by HX (being able to alloc linear memory at
    0x400000 is needed to load "fixed" Win32 binaries).

  þ DPMILD32 allocates the application's stack as committed memory. This is
    different to Win32, which usually just commits a - small - part of the
    stack space and then let it grow dynamically. Most applications just
    use a stack space of 1 MB, which usually is no problem, but some compilers
    set it to 16 or even 32 MB. HX's PE loader DPMILD32 can be instructed to
    limit the amount the stack space for an application to 128 kB. See
    description of environment variable switch DPMILDR=4096 in DPMILD32.TXT.

  þ The implementation of Win32 pipes requires SHARE to be loaded. Since
    there exists no working SHARE for FAT32 pipes often may not work. Few
    win32 applications rely on pipes, but one which needs them is Cygwin.
    Please note that the FreeDOS SHARE.COM is a very crippled implementation
    of SHARE, which won't help at all.

  þ Virtual PC 2007 needs a modified version of HDPMI32, which runs clients
    at IOPL 0. The binary is available at 
    http://www.japheth.de/Download/hdpmivpc.zip


  6. Files Overview

  a. Binaries for 32-Bit applications:

  þ HDPMI32.EXE: DPMI server for 32 bit clients, which is used in plain
    DOS only. HX's PE loader DPMILD32 will load HDPMI32 silently in the
    background if no DPMI API has been found. HDPMI is a fully functional
    DPMI host, which also includes DOS API translation services.

  þ DPMILD32.EXE: PE file loader. Usually this file is launched
    automatically either by HXLdr32.EXE or DPMIST32.BIN. View DPMILD32.TXT
    for more details.

  þ HXLdr32.EXE: TSR program to automatically run PE apps in plain DOS. View
    HXLdr32.TXT for more details.

  þ PESTUB.EXE: Tool to check if a PE file will be compatible with 
    DPMILD32 and to modify the MZ-Header of a PE file. Usually used
    to add DPMIST32.BIN to an existing PE app. View PEStub.TXT for more
    details.

  þ DKRNL32.DLL, DADVAPI.DLL, DUSER32.DLL, DGDI32.DLL, DDDRAW.DLL: Win32
    emulation dlls which will be loaded by DPMILD32 instead of the windows
    dlls KERNEL32.DLL, ADVAPI32.DLL, USER32.DLL, GDI32.DLL and DDRAW.DLL.
    View Doc\*.TXT and DPMILD32.TXT for more details.

  þ OLE32.DLL, OLEAUT32.DLL, VERSION.DLL, SECUR32.DLL: Some more Win32 
    Emulation dlls which have identical names as the dlls they are emulating.
    Rarely used.

  þ DPMIST32.BIN: this is a MZ stub to be added to PE binaries to make them
    run in DOS without help of HXLdr32. It is used either by PEStub.EXE or
    the linker. View DPMIST32.TXT for more details.

  þ VESA32.DLL: helper dll for VESA support in protected mode. View Vesa32.txt
    for more details.

  þ HXVDD.DLL: a Win32 VDD (Virtual Device Driver). Implements support for
    Windows clipboard when running in a NT/2K/XP DOS box. Not needed for
    plain DOS.

  b. Binaries for 16-Bit applications:

  þ HDPMI16.EXE: DPMI server for 16 bit clients.
  þ DPMILD16.EXE: NE file loader.

  c. Documentation in Doc subdirectory.

  d. Binaries in Unsupp directory

  þ DPMILD32.EXE: PE file loader with LFN support disabled.
  þ DOSX.EXE: replacement for Windows 3.1 DOSX.EXE. Will use HDPMI16 as DPMI
    host in windows standard mode.

  e. Others

  þ BIN\CLASSES: Helper file in BIN subdirectory to support creating COM
    objects with CoCreateInstance. 
  þ TEST\*.*: some tools to test various aspects of HX's win32 emulation.

                     HDPMI protected-mode code moved to extended memory,

                     is activated in Bin\HDPMI32.EXE and Bin\DPMILD32.EXE,
                     making Unsupp\HDPMI32.EXE and Unsupp\HDPMI16.EXE
