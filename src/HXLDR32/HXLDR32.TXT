
 1. About HXLdr32

 With this program one can avoid to change PE executables as it
 is done by tool PEStub to run Win32 apps in plain DOS. Instead
 this program will go resident, hook dos interrupt 21h and wait
 for any "load and execute program" calls. If one is catched, the
 file to execute is examined if it is a PE console app and if
 so, PE file loader DPMILD32.EXE will be started to run this app.

 This seems to be a more conveniant way than modifying binaries.
 
 
 2. Installing HXLdr32
 
 HXLdr32 is a TSR program, but it is a dos device driver as well.
 So you can install it in several ways. For example by adding a 
 line in CONFIG.SYS like:
 
 DEVICE=C:\TOOLS\HXLDR32.EXE C:\TOOLS\DPMILD32.EXE
 
 or let HXLdr32 install as TSR by entering in CONFIG.SYS:
 
 INSTALL=C:\TOOLS\HXLDR32.EXE

 Of course, as a TSR HXLdr32 can be installed at any time simply by
 typing its name. 

 When being installed as TSR, be sure DPMILD32.EXE is located somewhere
 in a directory of your PATH environment variable. When being installed
 as device driver, there is no environment available, that's why you will
 have to enter the full path of DPMILD32.EXE as an argument here.


 3. Uninstalling HXLdr32

 Type "HXLdr32 -u" to uninstall HXLdr32. Uninstallation will only work
 if HXLdr32 was installed as TSR, but not if it was installed as a device
 driver. 
 

 4. Known Problems
 
 þ Due to the nature of the "resident" approach there is a slight difference
   compared to changing PE executables with PEStub. Other dos-extended
   PE binaries will be executed by DPMILD32 as well, giving the
   containing stub no chance to take over. So for example apps created
   with the Borland extender (32RTM) will no longer start 32RTM.EXE.
   Usually this doesn't cause any problems, because HX's Win32 emulation  
   should be the most mature. However, if the stub *must* run while
   HXLDR32 is installed, use tool HXDOSLD.

 þ If you get error message:
     "dpmild32: <name of executable>: relocs stripped, cannot load"
   it may be necessary to set environment variable DPMILDR=8 (for
   a detailed description of DPMILDR variable view dpmild32.txt).

 þ HXLDR32 isn't compatible with DosBox. This is due to a bug in DosBox's
   emulation of DOS int 21h, ax=4B01h.
 
 
 5. History
 
 2009/11/16: version 1.12

 þ linker changed to OW WLink.
 
 2009/01/20: version 1.11

 þ source assembled with JWasm.
 
 2008/01/11: version 1.10
 
 þ bugfix: full path of binary to launch was restricted to 68, now is 80.
 
 2006/09/14: version 1.9.1
 
 þ bugfix: when loaded from the command line the terminating 00 of the
   DPMILD32 path may not have become resident if it happened to be located
   on a paragraph boundary, resulting in HXLDR32 unable to run Win32
   applications.
 
 2006/08/15: version 1.9

 þ linker options changed to make resulting binary a bit smaller.
   
 2006/07/15: version 1.8

 þ code simplified a bit. Previously the applications stack pointers
   were saved in an internal table which had just room for 8 entries.
   This restriction no longer exists.
 
 2005/11/12: version 1.7
 
 þ allow GUI apps to be loaded if running in true DOS.
 
 2005/09/17: version 1.6
 
 þ HXLdr32 now can be uninstalled - if it was installed as a TSR. 
 þ bugfix: if hxldr32 was started from the command line and dpmild32.exe
   was in the current directory, just the name of dpmild32.exe was saved
   internally. This made hxldr32 to not find dpmild32.exe if the current
   directory changed.
   
 2005/08/08: version 1.5
 
 þ flags in int 21h handler saved/restored.
 
 2005/07/31: version 1.4
 
 þ free unused space of DPMILD32.EXE full path.
 þ additional check for FileHeader.Machine == i386. There exist
   some (rather old) PE binaries (MS C V7.0) which cannot be loaded by 
   DPMILD32 and must use their own loader (MS32KRNL.DLL or DOSX32?)
   
 2004/11/25: version 1.3
 
 þ some PE binaries included in Borland's free commandline tools couldn't
   be loaded because they contained a value < 0x3E in field "relocation
   entries offset".
   
 2004/10/11: version 1.2
 
 þ sections .text and .rdata no longer merged because of potential problems.
 
 2004/08/28: version 1.1 
 
 þ bugfix: internal buffer too small for large paths.
 
 2004/05/04: version 1.0
