///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 1.  Introduction

     DPMILD16 is HX's loader for 16-bit NE binaries. It supports loading
     applications and dlls. Usually it is used to run HX DOS-extended
     applications, but there is also built-in support for loading 16-bit
     OS/2 binaries in DOS [for this task additional emulation dlls are 
     required, the essential ones can be found in the HXDEV16 package].
     
     DPMILD16 also exports some Win16 KERNEL functions which may simplify
     using a "standard" 16-bit Windows development tool to create
     DOS protected-mode applications. GUI functions are not supported. A
     library called KERNEL16.LIB is supplied with HXDEV16, containing
     references to all functions exported by DPMILD16.
     
     DPMILD16.EXE contains 16-bit code only and therefore should be able
     to run on a 80286.


 2.  Usage
 
     For HX DOS extended applications DPMILD16 will be launched automatically
     by a stub added to the binary during the link step. But it is also
     possible to run DPMILD16 manually:
     
     C:\>DPMILD16 <name of binary>
     
     File extension ".EXE" may be omitted. If the binary to run is not a
     valid NE file or is a Win16 GUI application, DPMILD16 will simply call
     DOS to run it. 
     
 
 3.  Environment variable DPMILDR

     By setting the environment variable DPMILDR you can control some aspects
     of the loader's behaviour. The variable is a number whose individual bits
     are interpreted as follows:

     - bit 0 (DPMILDR=1): tell the debugger to stop at program entry point.
       The debugger is notified by an int 41h with AX=0040h and CX:BX=CS:IP.
       If no debugger is present, this switch has no effect.

     - bit 1 (DPMILDR=2): prevents the loader from moving itself into extended
       memory. It remains in conventional DOS memory after switching to
       protected mode.

     - bit 3 (DPMILDR=8): instructs DPMILD16 to load not more than one
       application. This ensures that the application will use its dlls   
       exclusively and that it runs in its very own DPMI client. If HDPMI
       is used as DPMI host and environment variable HDPMI=32 is set as well,
       the application will indeed run in its very own address space.

     - bit 6 (DPMILDR=64): ignore SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX flag. With this
       setting the loader will display errors during module loads in any
       case.

     - bit 8 (DPMILDR=256): try to load NE debug dll DEBUGOUT.DLL
       at startup. This is mainly for compatibility with older versions,
       where the loader has tried to load this dll unconditionally.


 4.  Memory Model

     The memory model of DPMILD16.EXE is essentially the same as for
     16-bit NE binaries in Windows. All segments get a selector and will
     either be loaded immediately or just when they are used. Physical
     segments are limited to a maximum size of 64 KB, but there is support
     for huge segments, which might cover several contiguous 64 kB segments.

     Segment attributes handled by DPMILD16:

     - PRELOAD     segments are loaded before the application starts.
                   Huge segments will always be preloaded.
     - LOADONCALL  segments are loaded when the application touches them
     - MOVEABLE    not used by DPMILD16. Segments might only change their
                   linear address if they were discarded and then reloaded.
     - FIXED       segments are always "fixed" with DPMILD16. If both
                   FIXED and PRELOAD attributes are set, segment will be
                   loaded in conventional DOS memory (unless OS type is OS/2)
     - DISCARDABLE segments are removed from memory if DPMILD16 detects an
                   "out of memory" condition.
     - MIXED1632   segment will have the 'D' bit set in its descriptor.
     - ITERATED    segments marked as 'iterated' are somewhat "compressed".
                   They contain a list of items of the following structure:
                   WORD: Number of iterations
                   WORD: size of data to iterate in bytes
                   <nn>: data

     To allocate DOS memory either DPMI function 0x0101 or DPMILD16's
     GlobalDosAlloc() emulation might be used.

     If a dll is referenced the first time, its entry point will be called.
     If this call returns with AX=0, DPMILD16 assumes that the initialization
     failed and will unload the dll immediately. Otherwise, as in Windows
     a variable to count the module references is maintained. If the value
     of this variable becomes 0, the dlls WEP procedure is called - if one
     exists - and then the dll is unloaded.


 5.  DPMILD16 API

   a)  Int 21h API

     þ Int 21h, AX=4B00h (LoadModule/LoadLibrary): Loads a NE module
       dynamically.
       Input:
         DS:DX - must hold a far16 pointer to the name of the module to
                 load
         ES:BX - if an application is to be loaded, these must hold a
                 far16 pointer to a execute parameter block.
       Output:
         AX - if a dll has been loaded returns the module handle
              (or 0 if an error occured)
         C - error

       Applications will execute synchronously, like in standard DOS,
       and the calling application will regain control when the called
       application has finished. For dlls, the module handle is returned
       in AX, which is simply the NE module header.
       The loader will not  try to load applications having OS type 1
       (16-bit Windows) or 6 (DPMI32) and route such calls to DOS.

       Applications with application type 5 (DPMI16) will be entered
       with the following register contents:

       - SS,DS = DGROUP
       - ES = PSP
       - CX = stack size
       - BX = heap size
       - DI = hInstance
       - BP = 0
       
       The application is expected to call DPMILD16's InitTask() export
       as one of its first tasks.
       If the application has been patched by tool patchNE with option
       -r,  DS will contain the selector of the PSP to match the RTM.EXE
       behaviour. Furthermore, on return of InitTask(), DI will hold the
       module handle, not the hInstance anymore.
       
       Applications marked as OS/2 binaries will find the registers
       loaded as follows on entry:

       - SS,DS = DGROUP
       - ES = 0
       - AX = environment selector
       - BX = offset of cmdline in environment segment
       - CX = initial size of DGROUP
       - DX = stack size
       - SI = heap size
       - DI = module handle
       - BP = 0

     þ Int 21h, AX=4B80h (FreeLibrary): Free a NE module.
       Input:
         DX - the handle of the module to free
       Output:
         AX - 0 indicates a failure

     þ Int 21h, AX=4B85h (GetProcAddress): Get address of a procedure
       in a module.
       Input:
         BX - holds the module handle
         CL - determines the type of the export and how DX is interpreted.
              If CL=1, DX is interpreted as a number. If CL=0, DX is
              interpreted as offset to a name.
         DS:DX - points to name of procedure if CL=0.
       Output:
         DX:AX - Address of procedure

     þ Int 21h, AX=4B86h (GetModuleFileName): Get a pointer to a
       module's full path and file name.
       Input:
         DX - holds module handle.
       Output:
         DX:AX - returns a far address to the module's path.
         C - error

     þ Int 21h, AX=4B88h (GetModuleHandle16): Get the handle of a
       NE module.
       Input:
         CL - determines the type of the module reference. If CL=0,
              DX is interpreted as an offset. If CL=1, DX is
              interpreted as a selector.
         DS:DX - must point to the name of the module if CL=0.
       Output:
         AX - the module handle. AX=0 indicates a failure.
         DX - holds the module handle of kernel

     þ Int 21h, AX=4B91h: enable/disable loader. This feature may be
       useful if another 16 bit DPMI clients is to be launched, but
       requires its own loader (Borland RTM.EXE).
       Input:
         BL - contains new state (1=enable, 0=disable).

     þ Int 21h, AX=4B93h (SetErrorMode): Set error mode flag
       SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX. As default the loader displays
       error messages if it cannot load a module for some reason.
       Setting this flag will hide those messages.
       Input:
         EDX - new flags.

     þ Int 21h, AX=4B94h: Set new value of variable DPMILDR.
       Input:
         CX - mask for the bits to change
         DX - new values for these bits
       Output:
         AX - returns old value of the bits.

       __C000H
       __F000H
       __WINFLAGS


 6.  Returncodes

     Normally DPMILD16 returns the returncode of the (last) program it
     has executed. But there are several internal error conditions, which
     are reported to the caller through the following return codes:

     rc   comment                  possible reasons
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     FB   loader init error        cannot switch CPU in protected mode
                                   DOS translation services not available
                                   memory shrink error (in real mode)
                                   no selectors available
                                   no extended memory available
                                   no conventional memory available
     FC   client init error        no filename supplied
                                   file not found
                                   no selectors available
                                   no extended memory available
                                   no conventional memory available
     FD   error in exception 0Bh   no more memory
                                   error in NE exe file
     FE   application init error   imports couldn't be resolved
                                   dll init returns with ax/eax=0
     FF   fatalexit                application has called FatalExit or
                                   FatalAppExit

     DPMILD16 always displays an error text to STDERR in these cases.


 7.  Debugging Support

     DPMILD16 supports Int 41h in protected mode. That is, events such as
     loading a dll, starting a task, loading a segment a.s.o are all
     reported through calls to Int 41h with AX set appropriately.


 8.  History

 Since DPMILD16 and DPMILD32 share the same code base and many changes
 affect DPMILD32 only, there exist versions of DPMILD16 without any
 functional difference compared to the previous version.

 01.03.2008: version 3.5

 þ bugfix: SI was destroyed if a 16bit dll was loaded.
 
 15.03.2007: version 3.2.0

 þ bugfix: loading iterated segments may have caused a GPF.
 þ bugfix: GlobalFree didn't return 0 on success.
 þ GlobalAlloc no longer limited to sizes < 1 MB if cpu is 80386+. New limit
   is 512 MB, which comes from the 8192 LDT descriptor limit (64 kB * 8192).
 þ loader initialization simplified.
 þ loader available as MZ stub.
 þ export GlobalDOSFree added.
 þ GlobalCompact(-1) will remove all discardable segments from memory.

 14.12.2006: version 3.1.8

 þ bugfix: exports _AHINCR and _AHSHIFT did have wrong ordinals (_AHINCR
   had the intended _AHSHIFT value and vice versa).
 þ bugfix: int 21h, ax=4b93h was not handled by DPMILD16 and routed to
   real-mode (caused problems in DosBox).
 þ NE dlls reference counter wasn't always updated correctly under some
   circumstances.
 þ if a binary to load is linked as OS/2 NE application the loader will call
   it with a register set expected by OS/2 applications (thanks to ChowGuy
   who supplied the patch!).
 þ export GlobalCompact added.
 þ support for compatibility with Borland's RTM added ("PATCHNE -r").
 þ implemented support for loading "iterated" segments.

 15.10.2006: version 3.1.7

 þ exports GetFreeSpace, __C000H, __F000H added.

 05.09.2006: version 3.1.6

 þ GetMuduleFileName may have caused a GPF if an invalid hModule parameter
   was given.
 þ bugfix: GlobalFree modified ES. This should only happen if ES contains
   the selector of the block which was released (then ES should be set to 0)
 þ in GlobalRealloc interrupts were disabled by "pushf cli" and restored
   by testing the pushed flags. Now DPMI functions 0900h and 0901h are used.

 15.07.2006: version 3.1.5

 þ switch DPMILDR=8 no longer tries to "hide" the DPMI host.
 þ if DPMILDR=8 is set, the loader will no longer create a child PSP
   for the application to launch (since there will be just one application).
 þ int 2F, ax=168Eh (to set the console title in win9x) is now only called
   if system *is* win9x.

 14.06.2006: version 3.1.4
 15.05.2006: version 3.1.3
 02.05.2006: version 3.1.2
 30.03.2006: version 3.1.1
 27.02.2006: version 3.1.0
 05.02.2006: version 3.0.9

 þ error "invalid module handle" no longer displayed if flag
   SEM_NOOPENFILEBOX is set.

 20.12.2005: version 3.0.8
 06.12.2005: version 3.0.7

 þ DPMILD16 displays to stderr now.

 24.11.2005: version 3.0.6
 18.11.2005: version 3.0.5
 01.11.2005: version 3.0.4
 21.10.2005: version 3.0.3
 28.09.2005: version 3.0.2
 19.09.2005: version 3.0.1
 05.09.2005: version 3.0.0

 þ bugfix: launching a real-mode app may have failed just because
   MZ-Hdr contained a "big" value at offset 3Ch.
 þ bugfix: if an image contained no preloaded segments, it
   may have caused a crash if it wasn't loaded as the first
   app.

 28.08.2005: version 2.9.9

 þ int 21h, ax=4B86h and ax=4B88h implemented
 þ bugfix: GetModuleFilename didn't work with a HINSTANCE
 þ check for SS == codesegment extended to DPMILD16. This
   allows the tiny model (code and data in one group) with
   DPMILD16 as well.

 14.08.2005: version 2.9.8
 06.08.2005: version 2.9.7
 01.08.2005: version 2.9.6
 20.07.2005: version 2.9.5
 15.07.2005: version 2.9.4
 13.07.2005: version 2.9.3

 þ if OS type = OS/2, hold env selector in AX on startup.

 06.07.2005: version 2.9.2

 þ bugfix: DPMILD16 will now refuse to load a NE app marked as
   Windows app. This check was implemented long ago, but somehow
   had disappeared. Now implemented again.
 þ bugfix: DPMILD16 will now refuse to load a NE app marked as
   32bit. These are special HX modules loadable by DPMILD32 only.
 þ module count now updated earlier, so on task entry it should
   have the correct value already
 þ if binary type is OS/2, InitTask is called internally before
   control will be given to the application. This allows OS/2
   16bit apps to be run with DPMILD16 (if emulation dlls
   DOSCALLS/VIOCALLS/KBDCALLS exist).

 27.06.2005: version 2.9.1

 þ bugfix: load error in segment not present exception caused a
   fatal loader error (loader terminates)
 þ directory of .EXE added to dll search order (1. place)

 23.06.2005: version 2.9

 þ bugfix: export LoadModule crashed on return
 þ bugfix: _AHINRC/_AHSHIFT weren't exported with DM linker
