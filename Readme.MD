
Here's the most up-to-date version of HX DOS extender.

One should be able to create the binaries in both DOS and Windows (32- and 64-bit). 
Generally, the tools needed are JWasm, JWlink, JWlib, (MS) NMake and the HX development package (HXDEV).
For DUSER32.DLL, Open Watcom's WRC is also required.

Win32 emulation DLL WSOCK32 is deactivated in the Makefile, because it requires a
full OW installation and WATT-32 tcp/ip.

Prebuilt binaries are included as release "assets".
