
Here's the most up-to-date version of HX DOS extender.

One should be able to create the binaries in both DOS and Windows (32- and 64-bit). 
Generally, the tools needed are JWasm, JWlink, JWlib, a make utility and the HX development package (HXDEV).

Prebuilt binaries are included as release "assets".
