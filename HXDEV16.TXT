 
  1. About

   This package is for HX's support for 16-bit protected-mode applications.
  It is far more difficult to get (free) tools for creating such binaries
  than for 32-bit. As far as C is concerned, Open Watcom and Digital Mars
  are the only free ones I know of, but for both a 16-bit DOS extender is
  missing. This package contains:
  
   þ some OMF libraries and startup modules
   þ samples in ASM, C, Pascal and Cobol
   þ source code of the modules and libraries in Lib16
   þ support to use Open Watcom's WD for debugging 16-bit DPMI clients
   þ OS/2 and RTM emulation dlls.
  

  2. Installation
  
   First ensure that the HX runtime (HXRT) is already installed. It
  contains HX's 16-bit DPMI server HDPMI16.EXE and the 16-bit DPMI loader
  DPMILD16.EXE. You might get it from http://www.japheth.de/Download/hxrt.zip.

   This package (HXDV16) should then be unzipped in the same directory where
  HXRT has been installed. If you have installed the 32bit developer support
  you may be asked to overwrite some files (PatchNE.exe, PatchNE.txt,
  Dpmild16.txt). If HXDEV and HXDV16 have identical version numbers, the
  files are also identical. Else keep the newer ones. 

  
  3. Creating 16bit Binaries

  HX supports 2 file formats for 16-bit code, MZ and NE. The 16-bit
  NE format should be prefered, it allows to use dlls and the image
  is not restricted in size. A small catch is that to load such binaries
  a loader, DPMILD16.EXE, is required. It might be supplied as external 
  binary or it can be linked into the target as MZ stub. The simple MZ 
  format might just be a better choice for very small tools. It is 
  restricted to the small memory model anyway.
  
  Generally, the following environments have been tested to be able to
  create valid 16-bit HX binaries:
  
  - MASM, TASM, WASM, FASM, NASM, ...
  - Open Watcom C V1.3, V1.4 and V1.5
  - Borland C++ V3.0, V3.1 and V4.0 (see below)
  - MS C 6.00, MS VC++ V1.5 
  - Digital Mars C++ V8.4x
  - Borland Pascal 7.0 (see below)
  - MS Cobol V4.5
  
  View README.TXT and the samples in the SAMPLE16 subdir for more details.
  In README.TXT there is also a chapter which describes the tools available
  to debug 16-bit protected-mode binaries.
  
  Borland has supplied a 16-bit extender for both Borland C++ and Borland
  Pascal. However, one might consider to abandon the built-in extender and
  switch to HX. The Borland binaries (DPMI16BI.OVL and RTM.EXE) are
  known to have some bugs and are restricted to 64 MB extended memory.
  Tool patchNE may be able to make such applications compatible with
  HX's DPMI loader. Thus one can get rid of RTM.EXE and DPMI16BI.OVL.


  4. OS/2 Emulation - Why?
  
  The HX DOS extender has no C runtime library on its own and always
  relies on the native C RTL. This native C RTL must be protected-mode
  compatible to work with HX. With MS VC and Borland C++, there is 
  a simple solution by using the 16-bit Windows CRT libraries, but
  for Open Watcom and MS Cobol this approach won't work. For these
  environments the 16-bit OS/2 CRT has to be used instead. To resolve
  references to the OS/2 API, an OS/2 emulation has to be used. For
  more details see SAMPLE16\README.TXT
  
  
  5. Files Overview

 - BIN subdirectory:
 
   + DPMIST16.BIN, DPMILD16.BIN, HDLD16.BIN: MZ stubs to be used by the
     linker. DPMIST16.BIN will search for DPMILD16.EXE, DPMILD16.BIN will
     search for HDPMI16.EXE. HDLD16.BIN needs no external modules.
   + PATCHNE.EXE: tool to set some flags in a NE header. Might also be
     used to replace the MZ stub of a NE binary.
   + USER.DLL, RTM.DLL: required for Borland PowerPack compatibility.
     Native PowerPack applications load RTM.EXE, which contains some
     Win16 exports found in KERNEL, USER, KEYBOARD and additionally some
     exports unique to RTM. In HX, the KERNEL emulation is included in 
     DPMILD16.EXE, but exports of other modules are missing and therefore
     these dll are needed.
   + DOSCALLS.DLL, NLS.DLL, KBDCALLS.DLL, VIOCALLS.DLL:
     OS/2 16-bit emulation dlls needed to run HX NE binaries which were
     created by linking with DOSXXX.LIB.

 - DOC subdirectory: descriptions of NE loader DPMILD16 and PATCHNE.
           
 - LIB16 subdirectory: modules and libraries in OMF format.

   + SLX.LIB: modules to be used when using MS VC 1.5 small model
   + LLX.LIB: modules to be used when using MS VC 1.5 large model
   + KERNEL16.LIB: import library containing the windows 16-bit exports
     emulated by DPMILD16.EXE. 
   + DOSXXX.LIB: import library for OS/2 emulation dlls, to be used
     if Open Watcom (WCC + WLINK) or MS Cobol is to create a NE binary
     and the OS/2 emulation layer should not be included in the binary.
   + DOSXXXS.LIB: static library containing OS/2 emulation code. Will 
     cause the linker to add the emulation layer into the binary.
   + JMPPM16.OBJ: startup module for simple MZ binaries (ASM).
   + JMPPM16W.OBJ: startup module to be used if Open Watcom (WCC + WLINK)
     is to create a MZ binary.
   + JMPPM16M.OBJ: startup module to be used if MS VC 1.5 is to create
     a MZ binary.
   + CSTRT16X.OBJ: modified OW CSTRTO16.ASM module for HX NE format.
   + CSTRT16Z.OBJ: modified OW CSTRTO16.ASM module for HX MZ format.
   + BCHELP.OBJ: helper module to make object modules compiled with
     Borland C++ compatible with MS VC runtime.

 - OWSUPP16 subdirectory: helper files to support Open Watcom tools
   WD (debugger) and WLINK (linker).

 - SAMPLE16 subdirectory: samples in ASM, C, Pascal and COBOL.
   
 - SRC subdirectory: source code of 
   + MZ Startup: JMPPM16.OBJ, JMPPM16m.OBJ and JMPPM16w.OBJ
   + DOSXXX: OS/2 emulation, DOSXXX.LIB, DOSXXXS.LIB, DOSCALLS.DLL, ... 
   + RTMSUBST: RTM substitution, RTM.DLL and USER.DLL
